Personal Linux desktop configuration.

I put here common configurations/settings/setups/preferences/applications that I used on my different Linux Desktops.

# Desktop

I used Arch Linux, with Gnome and Awesome Window Manager.

## Gnome

* Version: 3.10

## Awesome

* Version: 3.5.2-1
* Configuration: [config/awesome](config/awesome)

# Applications

## Utilities

* [Gnome-Do](https://launchpad.net/do) is an intelligent launcher tool that makes performing common tasks on your computer simple and efficient.

## Sound

* [VolWheel](http://oliwer.net/b/volwheel.html) is a little application which lets you control the sound volume easily through a tray icon you can scroll on.
